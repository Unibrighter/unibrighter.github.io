Imagine the data flowed through the lifecycle of the programm.</li></ul></li><li>We can agree that this will always envolve and grow together with the development itself, which leads to this conclusion, this the nature of the data flow.</li><li>Do not using "Add Packages" from Xcode, instead, creating a new package project under <code>Packages</code> folder and then drag it into the project to make a versatile management.</li><li>Project growing</li><li>Trying to decoupling and adding modularisation too early might not be a good idea.<ul><li>Instead, do a quick demo MVP as 1.0.0, and then carry out the modularisation process instead only at this stage.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3>2024-03-03</h3><h4>Usage of Transferable and UTType</h4><ul><li>UTType (used in DataRepresentation/FileRepresentation) is a concept for denoting the real type in the file system.</li><li>This could be linked to the concept of the magic block etc to uniquely mark a file's type.</li><li>In the meanwhile, loadTransferable is the new way convert an instance to some other type, as long as the original type can be data presentation/file representation, and the target type defines how to initialise from it.</li></ul><h3>2024-03-04</h3><h4>Dev Path</h4><ul><li>Can't figure out a clear path with known methodology to spawn the project codebase bit by bit.</li><li>It's either in a state of fully functioning or in the middle of somewhere you can't see the progress. Hard to mark the milestones.</li><li>In other words, the primary function and the branches function get twisted together. Without finishing the primary part to make a fully functioning live demo, I turn to handle other less critical codes. How to focus on the Minimum Demo?<ul><li>Why not chekcing the other successful App with open-sourced repo git history???</li></ul></li></ul><h3>2024-03-05</h3><h4>Data flow and Environment</h4><p>Have a better understanding of the environment virable. It's not easy to use as I thought - we can't link State variable</p><h4>SwiftUI's PROs and cons</h4><p>Using SwiftUI can save tons of time regarding the UI, but it requires you to have a clear mindset about how the data are flowing, and you need to know what you are doing for management the data flow. Without this, it's hard to efficiently using SwiftUI, since the logics are closely coupled with the data Observable.</p><h3>2024-03-06</h3><h4>Preview For Binding property behaviour testing</h4><p>When using preview for binding property testing, we can't use state directly delcared in the #Preview Macro, instead, inside the content, define a new wrapper struct and declare the State over there. This allows the view functions mocking the the way it's used in real codes.</p><h4>Tapping Area and conflicts for tapping gesture</h4><p>When using gesture on Stack Containers, Spacers sitting within sometimes lead to a small content area, this could be fixed by</p><p><code>.contentShape(Rectangle())</code></p><p>If a tapping gesture has been defined inside a child view, then adding a tapping gesture on the parent view will leads to conflicts. This could be fixed by using <code>simultaneousGesture</code> like below:</p><pre><code class="language-swift">VStack {
    Text("Tap me")
        .onTapGesture {
            print("Text was tapped")
        }
    Text("Another Text")
}
.simultaneousGesture(
    TapGesture().onEnded { _ in
        print("VStack was tapped")
    }
)
</code></pre><h4>Right developing path</h4><p>When building the App, breaking it down to two major parts, which consist of multiple mall logics modules: 1. UI part 2. Logics part</p><h4>For logics part (TOP to Bottom approach when designing -&gt; Bottom to Top when implementing)</h4><p>It's easy to verify these without any UI, as primary logics can be tested using output. When doing this, you need to put the consumer as the first place, so that in the general picture, it's just one line of codes doing all stuff. Whatever the simplest would be the best approach. Usually when you making a clear SDK API, the codes should be really intuitive.</p><p>Taking the transferable protocol implementation for LocalImage as an example. The codes should just be 1.) copy the url to the right temporary folder + 2.) set up the instance to represent the images in the temporary folder. If you have already thought this through, you should be able to tell that there is no need to bring in extra layer of Folder/File entity defined in the 3rd party lib, which complicate things overall.</p><h4>For UI parts (Bottom to Top approach)</h4><p>It's hard to get all the stuff out in the most top level. When doing UI, design the most basic parts first. But adjusting UI should be already at the final stage. When doing MVP, using a List/ScrollView to scram everything for work flow testing into a <code>Page</code>.</p><h4>absoluteString vs. Path</h4><p>absoluteString includes protocol, like <code>file://abc</code>, Path is just the part without protocol.</p><h3>2024-03-07</h3><h4>State vs. Binding</h4><p>Use state and Binding as natural type as possible. In other words, if there is an enum, then don't define the computed variable in enum's definition, instead, having both state and binding delared to that enum type in View part. The computed logics should happen in the Binding, as this is the place for logics computing, and has better self-governing for the subView using binding delcaration.</p><h4>SwiftUI active response</h4><p>Basically if a State is updated in non-main thread, it will pose a risk of inconsistency for the UI as these changes won't notify the SwiftUI update. Basically SwiftUI is like observable UI changes to data model only happen in main thread. This saves the trouble for you to manually call tableView.reloadData() but you still need to ensure the updates happen in mainthread.</p><h3>2024-03-09</h3><h4></h4><p>The animation is still bugging me, however, considering the input effort and output effect, it's not worth spending too much time on this release TODO:</p><ul><li>External link in MoreMenu</li><li>Privacy policy + Terms statement in MoreMenu</li><li>(Optional) The buggy animation for the foldable<ul><li>It turns out the animation bug of unclear layout structure. Placing the animation part in H/VStack, and Group will help.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>2024-03-10</h3><h4>SnapShot integration</h4><p>There is a disgusting bug for UI/Unit tests in Xcode15, you have to manually set the excute in parallel in test option settings. And even if you do this, it's impossible to pass this parameters via snapshot to the xcbuild command, which means you CANNOT run <code>fastlane snapshot</code> command.</p><ul><li>see - https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/735645</li></ul><p>Trying to upgrade to the latest version of Xcode to see if this helps. In the meanwhile, disabled excute in parallel option, and begin to record the screenshots.</p><h3>2024-03-10</h3><h4>Remaining Agenda</h4><p>The original function of the App has been migrated to the new App built in SwiftUI! Now there are some new challenges while we picking up some other new project ideas:</p><p>-[] Automation for screenshot - Can't make it working!!! Need further investigation. - Currently still need to manually screenshot. - Otherwise it'll be a great deal amount of work when there are multiple languages.</p><p>-[x] Remove past records</p><p>-[x] Localisation: Add Support for multiple languages</p><p>-[x] Use SEO/ASO strategy to see if manual effort could play some role in bumping the App rating and usage. - This is a really large topic - And an existing tool is SensorTower again.
